Forensic Scripts

Currently this project contains assorted Perl/Python scripts from http://cheeky4n6monkey.blogspot.com/
In December 2021, an attempted cleanup was done - scripts were sorted into folders by OS, Perl language or "utilities" (if you're not sure where a Python script moved to, its probably here).

The scripts were initially written for/tested on SANS SIFT Virtual Machines. 
MOST Perl scripts should also run with ActiveState Perl on Windows but ALL have been tested/run on SANS SIFT (v2). 
Python Scripts have been developed/tested on Ubuntu and/or Windows 7/10.
